🌐 This **Heart Disease** dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and you can also download it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)

### The notebook implements the Decision Tree Classification Algorithm using Python's scikit-learn library
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
    - I have tried One-hot encoding and the **Cost Complexity Pruning** method to get the best possible classifier
- **Decision Tree Regeressor**
    - I will add soon :)
