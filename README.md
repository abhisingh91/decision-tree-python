🌐 This **Heart Disease** dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Repository and you can also download it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)

### The notebooks implement Decision Tree Algorithms using Scikit-learn library
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
    - I have tried One-hot encoding and **Cost Complexity Pruning** method to get the best possible classification model
- **Decision Tree Regeressor**
    - I will add soon :)
